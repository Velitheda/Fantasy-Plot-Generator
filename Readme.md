# Fantasy Plot Generator

This is a simple script I wrote to try out Kotlin.

It generates a random plot along the lines of these:

```
In a soft realm, a soft homeless warrior must embark on a quest to retreive a blue lily
in order to save their kingdom from the threat of an imminent political conspiracy.
At a pivotal moment, a preventable irreversible magic spell will occur. A bowl will keep showing up at odd times.
```

```
In a blue realm, a cold bold vampire must embark on a quest to retreive a green nail
in order to save their kingdom from the threat of an imminent disaster.
At a pivotal moment, a preventable murder will occur. A map will keep showing up at odd times.
```

```
In a blue realm, a green naive princess must embark on a quest to retreive a happy lemon
in order to save their kingdom from the threat of an imminent poisoning.
At a pivotal moment, a suprising resurrection will occur. A towel will keep showing up at odd times.
